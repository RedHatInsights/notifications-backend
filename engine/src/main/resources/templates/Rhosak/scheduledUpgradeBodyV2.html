    Upgrade Notification
{/content-title-section1}
{#content-body-section1}
    <p>
        This notification is for your OpenShift Streams instance{#if action.events.size() > 1}s{/if} listed below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            {#each action.events}
            <li style="font-size: 14px;">
                {it.payload.name}
            </li>
            {/each}
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The listed {#if action.events.size() is 1} instance is{#else} instances are{/if} scheduled for upgrade maintenance to Kafka version {action.context.kafka_version} on {action.context.upgrade_time.toUtcFormat()}.
        The maintenance window for the upgrade is variable, but should take approximately {action.context.upgrade_duration} minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What can you expect?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximum throughput of an OpenShift Streams instance might briefly decrease during upgrade. However, the instance will remain operational.</li>
            <li>The Kafka brokers in an OpenShift Streams instance will be upgraded one at a time. During this process, a producer or consumer will briefly disconnect from its current broker and fail over to one of the other brokers in the instance.</li>
            <li>Weâ€™ll send you further reminders as we get closer to the upgrade date.</li>
        </ul>
