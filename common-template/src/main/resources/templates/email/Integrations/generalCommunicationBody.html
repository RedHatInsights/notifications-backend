{#content-body-section1}
    <p>Dear Red Hat customer,</p>
    <p>We are contacting you because you have the following Microsoft Teams integrations set up for your organization in the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.redhat.com">Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console</a>:</p>
    <ul>
        {#for integrationName in action.events[0].payload.integration_names}
        <li>{integrationName}</li>
        {/for}
    </ul>
    <p>
        Microsoft is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/#why-are-we-retiring-office-365-connectors">retiring Office 365 connectors in favor of Power Automate workflows</a>,
        and they are requesting that their customers transition from <i>Office 365 connectors</i> they have set up to <i>Workflows</i>.
        Please review the Microsoft Teams integrations identified above and update them if needed, to avoid service interruption when Microsoft retires the old connectors.
        <strong>If you have already updated your integrations to <i>Microsoft Workflows</i>, you can safely ignore this email</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>You can update your Microsoft Teams integrations by following the steps in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/1-latest/html-single/integrating_the_red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console_with_third-party_applications/index#assembly-configuring-integration-with-teams_integrating-communications">Integrating communications applications with the Hybrid Cloud Console</a> in the Red Hat documentation.</p>
    <p>Following the above steps will ensure that you will continue receiving the alerts and notifications in the Microsoft Teams channel that you have configured.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
    <p>Kind regards,</p>
    <p>Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console</p>
